<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Today you will see how to explain to your CPU that your plan is to calculate
<code>2+2</code>, and see how <strong>words</strong> (i.e. numbers) in memory can be formed and
interpreted as <strong>opcodes</strong> (operation codes) which will instruct your CPU to do
things (e.g. add two values).</p>

<p>Even though this is a “first steps” type of lab, the things you’ll do in this
lab are essential for the rest of this course, so make sure you understand <em>everything</em> in
your program what is happening in front of you. Anything you leave hanging here
will probably haunt you in the coming weeks. Don’t feel like everyone else is
getting it and you’re the only one that’s lost—that’s <em>definitely</em> not the
case.</p>

<h2 id="two-plus-two">Exercise 1: 2+2</h2>

<p>Fork &amp; clone the <a href="https://github.com/CanberraGrammar/cc-ext-2018-discoboard-lab-2">lab 2 template</a> to your machine (just
like you did <a target="_blank" href="../lab-1/index.html">in Lab 1</a>).</p>

<p>Your job in this first exercise is to write an assembly program which calculates
<code>2+2</code> and leaves the result in register 1 (<code>r1</code>).</p>

<p>Remember from last week’s lab that you can see the values in your discoboard’s
registers (assuming there’s a debugging session running and the execution is
paused) in the registers pane:</p>

<p><img src="register-viewlet-0e721d077e62c8607190a5bee60deb53c39de4f360f065227340812c9318e179.png" /></p>

<p class="info-box">You can set the numeric format for a specific register in the register view.
Simply right click on the register, select “set number format” and then select
the desired format. This will help you make sense of the value of a register.</p>

<h3 id="arm-assembly-syntax">ARM assembly syntax</h3>
<p>This is probably the first time you’ve written any ARM assembly code, so for
this course we’ve prepared a <a target="_blank" href="../assets/manuals/ARMv7-cheat-sheet.pdf">cheat
sheet</a> to help you out.
It looks pretty intimidating at first—mostly because it crams a lot of
information into a small space. So let’s pick one line of the cheat sheet—the
<code>sub</code> instruction—and pick it apart.</p>

<p>First, the <strong>syntax</strong> column:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ARM">sub{s}&lt;c&gt;&lt;q&gt; {&lt;Rd&gt;,} &lt;Rn&gt;, &lt;Rm&gt; {,&lt;shift&gt;}
</code></pre>

<p>The first token on the line is the instruction name, and after that is the
(comma-separated) argument list. Just like any other programming language, once
you understand the syntax you can read and understand the code. In fact, since
it’s a smaller language (there are only a couple of dozen instructions) it’s
probably easier to read than languages with a richer syntax.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>anything in braces (<code>{}</code>) is <em>optional</em>, e.g. the <code>s</code> at the end of <code>sub{s}</code>
means that it can be either <code>sub</code> or <code>subs</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <code>&lt;c&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> parts relate to the <strong>condition codes</strong> and <strong>opcode
size</strong> boxes on the second page of the cheat sheet - they’re <em>also optional</em> and
you probably won’t need them for this first exercise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>{&lt;Rd&gt;,}</code> is the <strong>d</strong>estination register (e.g. <code>r3</code> or <code>r11</code>), which is
optional because if it’s omitted the result will be stored in the <code>&lt;Rn&gt;</code>
register (which is why the <strong>semantic</strong> column says <code>Rd(n) := ...</code>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>&lt;Rn&gt;, &lt;Rm&gt;</code> are the two operands (arguments) for the <code>sub</code> instruction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>finally, the <em>optional</em> <code>{,&lt;shift&gt;}</code> part is related to the barrel shifter
(for bit-shifting operations) built alongside the discoboard’s ALU - you don’t
have to worry about this too much for the moment but it’ll come in handy later</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of other parts of the syntax which aren’t covered in the
<code>sub</code> instruction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>constant values (e.g. numbers) are written normally (e.g. <code>24</code> for decimal
numbers) although you can add a prefix to indicate a different base: <code>0b</code> for
binary (e.g. <code>0b1101101</code>), <code>0o</code> for octal (e.g. <code>0o125</code>) or <code>0x</code> for
hexadecimal (<code>0xef20</code>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when it comes to load &amp; store operations, square brackets <code>[]</code> indicate that
the instruction should use the memory address in the register, e.g. <code>[r2]</code>
tells the discoboard to “use the memory address in <code>r2</code>” for that instruction</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You won’t need to know all of this stuff to complete this lab, so just remember
that it’s here if you need to come back to it. Let’s keep going…</p>

<p>The <strong>semantic</strong> column on your cheat sheet describes what the instruction does.
For example, the semantic for the <code>sub</code> instruction is <code>Rd(n) := Rn -
Rm{shifted}</code>, which in English translates to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in the <code>Rd</code> register (or <code>Rn</code>, if there are only two register operands
present) store the result of subtracting the value in the <code>Rm</code> register (with
an optional bit-shift, if present) from the value in the <code>Rn</code> register</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can probably see why we use assembly language for telling our CPU what to do
rather than English—it’s much less wordy.</p>

<p>The <strong>flags</strong> column of the cheat sheet specifies which of the special condition
code flags that instruction sets if the optional <code>s</code> suffix is present. (We’ll
cover this in Lab 3, but if you’re curious there’s a box on the second
page of the cheat sheet which lists the flags.)</p>

<p class="info-box">Whew, that was a bit of an information dump. But it was worth picking it apart in
detail, since you’ll be looking at the cheat sheet (and ARM instruction syntax)
a lot.</p>

<h3 id="the-task">The task</h3>

<p>To actually complete your “2 + 2” task, you’ll need to</p>
<ol>
  <li>get number <code>2</code> into a register</li>
  <li>add <em>another</em> <code>2</code> to it and put the result in <code>r1</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Look over the cheat sheet—which assembly instructions allow you to specify
numeric contsants/literals in a register? There are also a number of machine
instructions which will implement an addition—which one do you want, and
<em>why?</em></p>

<p>Once you’ve written a program which you think will do what you want, step
through and make sure that the value which <code>r1</code> holds at the end is actually
<code>4</code>.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-engineering">Exercise 2: reverse engineering</h2>

<p>Now we really look under the hood and leave no bit unturned. Start a debugging
session with your program from the previous exercise and step through until you
get to <code>main</code>, then leave it “hanging”—do not execute any further.</p>

<p class="think-box">Do you know where each of your “number 2”s are represented in your program when
it’s actually running on your discoboard?</p>

<p>To do that we need to be able to view the memory in the disco board. In VSCode
you can look at your memory directly using the <strong>Memory View</strong>: type
<code>Cortex-Debug: View Memory</code> in the <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette">command
palette</a>
(or some part of it—the command palette “fuzzy matches” on command names).
VSCode will then ask you to input the <strong>starting address</strong> and the <strong>number of
bytes</strong> to read (e.g. <code>42</code> bytes).</p>

<p><img src="memory-view-4fb5c0ef63dd7f559b1b7d3886c16cfc5d800747516fddc565761c4a0b61374c.png" /></p>

<p>This might look overwhelming, but the 2D “grid” layout is pretty simple: the hex
numbers down the left hand side are the base memory addresses, and the
hex numbers along the top represent the “offset” of that particular byte from
the base address. So, to work out the exact address of a particular byte
(remember: 2 hex digits == 1 byte) you read along the <em>row</em> to get the base
address, and read down the <em>column</em> to get the offset, and add them together
(base+offset) to get the address of the byte. Simples!</p>

<p class="talk-box">You can <strong>definitely</strong> find the bytes in memory which correspond to the
instructions you wrote in your <code>main.S</code> file in this view. The trick is figuring
out where to look—what should the starting address be? Even your humble
discoboard has a <strong>lot</strong> of addressable memory. Discuss with your lab
neighbor—where should you look to find your program? What if I told you that
the (<code>pc</code>) register stood for <code>p</code>rogram <code>c</code>ounter?</p>

<p>If you get stuck, here’s a trick which is often helpful in reverse engineering
things—try and put some <em>known</em> values into the program so that we know what
we’re looking for when we’re staring at the memory view.</p>

<p>There’s an assembler directive called
<a target="_blank" href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/hword.html#hword"><code>.hword</code></a> which you
can use to put 16-bit numbers into your program (“hword” is short for half-word,
and comes from the fact that your discoboard’s CPU uses 32-bit “words”).</p>

<p>Modify your program to use the <code>.hword</code> directive to put some data into your
program.</p>

<pre><code class="language-arm">.syntax unified
.global main
.type main, %function

main:
  .hword 0xdead
  .hword 0xbeef
  b main
.size main, .-main
</code></pre>

<p>Build &amp; upload your program and open a memory view and go to the address of your
first instruction (or a bit before—as long as the number of bytes you display
spans over the memory region you’re interested in). You might need to re-size
the different viewlets to make sure you can see all the columns of the memory
view. Can you see the <code>0xdead</code> and <code>0xbeef</code> values you put into your program? If
you can’t see them <em>exactly</em>, can you see something which looks suspiciously
like them? What do you notice?</p>

<p class="talk-box">If you try to run your program (stepping/continuing past the first initial breakpoint, in the <code>startup_stm32l476xx.S</code> file) it crashes &mdash; more specifically, it throws an exception and then puts the program into an endless loop so it hangs for inspection with the debugger). Why is this happening? Why doesn't the program run anymore?</p>

<h3 id="endianness">Endianness</h3>

<p>To make sense of the numbers displayed in the memory view, we need to talk about
<em>endianness</em>.</p>

<p>Values are stored in memory as individual <strong>bytes</strong> (i.e. 8-bit numbers, which
can be represented with two hex digits). <strong>Endianness</strong> refers to the order in
which these small 8-bit bytes are arranged into larger numbers (e.g. 32-bit
<strong>words</strong>). In the <strong>little-endian</strong> format, the byte stored at the lowest
address is the <strong>least</strong> significant byte; where as in <strong>big-endian</strong> format,
the byte stored at the lowest address is the <strong>most</strong> significant byte.</p>

<p>Here’s an example: suppose we have the number <code>0x01</code> stored at a lower memory
address (e.g. <code>0x000001e0</code>), and the number <code>0xF1</code> stored at a higher memory
address (<code>0x000001e1</code>), as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="endian-example-6f373fdc0b02a4b72307d458121190649df3c4bd16208c6728167596bb933a23.png" /></p>

<p>Under the <strong>little-endian</strong> format, when these two 8-bit numbers are read as one
16-bit half-word number by the CPU, it represents <code>0xF101</code> (the <code>0x01</code> at the
lower address is treated as less significant). And under the <strong>big-endian</strong>
format, it represents <code>0x01F1</code> (the <code>0x01</code> at the lower address is treated as
more significant).</p>

<p>When reading four bytes from the memory, the CPU can read them as two 16-bit
half-words, or as one 32-bit word. The endianness format applies everytime when
combining bytes into bigger words. The following diagram illustrates this using
the little-endian format:</p>

<p><img src="little-endian-cedb2199f2106f3df54f19cab67b47935401a9b4d89459cd42d68ab425ddc964.jpg" /></p>

<p>You need to be aware of this byte ordering to make sense of the memory view. It
might be painful and confusing at the start, but you’ll get used to it.</p>

<p class="extension-box">How might you figure out on your discoboard’s Cortex-M4 CPU whether a 32-bit
instruction is read as one 32-bit word or as two 16-bit half-words? (hint:
have a look at A5.1 in the <a href="../assets/manuals/ARMv7-M-architecture-reference-manual.pdf">ARM®v7-M Architecture Reference Manual</a>).</p>

<p class="info-box">According to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Etymology">Wikipedia</a>,
Danny Cohen introduced the terms <em>Little-Endian</em> and <em>Big-Endian</em> for byte
ordering in an article from 1980. In this technical and political examination of
byte ordering issues, the “endian” names were drawn from Jonathan
Swift’s<sup id="fnref:no-relation"><a href="#fn:no-relation" class="footnote">1</a></sup> 1726 satire, Gulliver’s Travels, in which civil war erupts
over whether the big end or the little end of a boiled egg is the proper end to
crack open, which is analogous to counting from the end that contains the most
significant bit or the least significant bit.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-encodings">Instruction encoding(s)</h3>

<p>Now that you know how bytes fit together into words, let’s get back to the task
of figuring out how the instructions in your program are encoded in memory.</p>

<p>To help, you can use the known half-words you put into your program earlier to
help you out. Update your program like so to add a single instruction (i.e. one
line of assembly code) from the your 2+2 program you wrote in <a href="#two-plus-two">Exercise
1</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-arm">.syntax unified
.global main
.type main, %function

main:
  .hword 0xdead
  @ put a single "real" assembly insruction here from your 2+2 program
  .hword 0xbeef
  b main
.size main, .-main
</code></pre>

<p>Build, upload and start a new debug session (but don’t run it, just leave it
paused) then find your program again in the memory view. What does your
instruction look like in memory? If it helps, try making a note of the bytes,
then modify the instruction slightly (e.g. change the number, or the register
you’re using) and see how the bytes change in memory (you’ll need to re-build &amp;
run your program and call the view memory command each time you do).</p>

<p class="talk-box">Discuss with your neighbour: what do you think the different bits (and bytes) in
the instruction encoding <em>mean</em>? How does the discoboard know what to do with
them? And if you’ve figured that out, why doesn’t your program actually <em>work</em>?</p>

<p>To fully make sense of these instruction encodings you need more than just your
cheat sheet, you need the <a target="_blank" href="../assets/manuals/ARMv7-M-architecture-reference-manual.pdf">ARM®v7-M Architecture Reference
Manual</a>).
You need to dig to the deepest levels, by going to <strong>section A7.7</strong>
<em>Alphabetical list of ARMv7-M Thumb instructions</em> (page A7-184). Use the
bookmarks in your pdf viewer to navigate to the relevant instructions inside
this huge 400 page section.</p>

<p>For each instruction you will see a number of encodings. They detail bit-by-bit
the different ways of specifying the machine instructions that your discoboard
CPU understands. You may also find this number format conversion tool helpful:</p>

<script>
 "use strict";

 // The original logarithmic left-pad that rose to fame
 function padZeroes(input, length) {

   if (input.length > length){
     return input;
   }

   let padChar = "0";
   return padChar.repeat(length - input.length) + input;
 }

 function formatWithGrouping(string) {
   // currently only works if string length mod 4 == 0
   let splitter = (coll, x, i) => {
     return (i % 4 == string.length % 4 ? " " : "") + x + coll;
   }
   return string.split("").reduceRight(splitter).trim();
 }

 function twosComplement(value, bits) {
   if (value >= 0) {
     return value;
   } else {
     return Math.pow(2, bits) + value;
   }
 }

 function fieldElement(id) {
   return document.getElementById(id + "_val");
 }

 function recalc(kind) {
   var new_value = fieldElement(kind).value.replace(/ /g, "");
   if (kind === "hex") {
     new_value = parseInt(new_value, 16);
   } else if (kind === "bin") {
     // need to strip the 0b prefix because js is dumb
     new_value = parseInt(new_value.substring(2), 2);
   } else if (kind === "dec") {
     new_value = parseInt(new_value);
   } else if (kind === "str") {
   }

   if (isNaN(new_value)) {
     new_value = 0;
   }

   if (kind != "hex") {
     fieldElement("hex").value = "0x " + formatWithGrouping(padZeroes(twosComplement(new_value, 32).toString(16), 8));
   }
   if (kind != "bin") {
     fieldElement("bin").value = "0b " + formatWithGrouping(padZeroes(twosComplement(new_value, 32).toString(2), 32));
   }
   if (kind != "dec") {
     fieldElement("dec").value = new_value;
   }
 }

<p class="extension-box">Can you tell which specific encoding has been used? Note that not every encoding
can express every version of the instruction, but sometimes a more complex
encoding can also express what the a simpler form could have done as well. Can
you hint the assembler towards the specific encoding you want?</p>

<h2 id="excercise-3-hand-crafted-artisinal-organic-instructions">Excercise 3: hand-crafted, artisinal organic instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve identified the spot in memory where your instructions live, in
this exercise we turn our approach around and program the CPU by writing
specific numbers directly to memory locations.</p>

<p>Now, instead of calculating <code>2+2</code>, you are going to make the CPU calculate <code>3-1</code>
by putting the right numbers into memory.</p>

<p>In fact, you have been doing this all along, except that the assembler has
helped you in calculating those numbers. Replace your program with the following
assembly code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-arm">.syntax unified
.global main
.type main, %function

main:
  .hword 0xffff
  .hword 0xffff
  b main
.size main, .-main
</code></pre>

<p>only this time instead of the <code>0xffff</code>s you need to figure out the actual values
which will make the CPU load <code>3</code> into a <code>r1</code> and subtract <code>1</code> from it. Remember
that it’ll be <em>similar</em> to the words you looked at in the memory viewer earlier,
but some of the bits will be different (since we’re dealing with <code>-</code>, <code>3</code> and
<code>1</code> instead of <code>+</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>2</code>).</p>

<p>Note the line at the bottom:</p>

<pre><code class="language-arm">.size main, .-main
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the assembler the size of the <code>main</code> function, and it is essential
for the <strong>disassembler</strong> to work correctly. The disassembler view can be opened
by typing <code>Cortex-Debug: View Disassembly (Function)</code> in the command palette
during an active debug session (thus you need to first compile, upload your code
and start a debug session). It will then ask for which function to disassemble,
type the function name (e.g. <code>main</code>). It will look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="disassembly-view-22ab2e4fa9d8c95e87dc6225c5b205ed56509ba9bd604ccfe058b096627c7583.png" /></p>

<p>Bring up the disassembler view for <code>main</code>—you’re now looking at the program as
it will be understood by the CPU. You can even do step debugging in disassembly
view; it’s automatic based on which source tab you have active<sup id="fnref:flaky"><a href="#fn:flaky" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p class="think-box">Looking at the disassembled code (i.e. the way the CPU will interpret the
instructions) did you see what you intended? Will your new, hand-assembled
program show the correct result in <code>r1</code> after it has been run? If it doesn’t,
what might have gone wrong?</p>

<p>You can now cheer as loud as your upbringing allows that you will never again
have to hand-craft the bits needed to instruct the CPU to do this, and you can
leave this job to the assembler from now on.</p>

<p>As a side effect, you also learnt something about security: your system can be
compromised by injecting some data into memory (an array of numbers, a string or
anything which the host system would accept) and making the CPU somehow stumble
into executing it. Classically this is done in form of buffer overruns in C
programs (very few other languages allow that sort of thing) where you can make
your program write data into places where the executable code lives… and
bingo!</p>

explain the way a CPU works to your grandma/grandpa?</p>

then represents the current value of the active location counter, and is, for
example, a suitable instruction operand. You are warned if you use the same
symbol to represent two different locations: the first definition overrides any
other definitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in the code above there are two new labels: <code>cope</code> and <code>loop</code>. A label is a
way of attaching a human-readable name to a location in your sequence of
instructions (i.e. your program). But always remember that it’s just a location
marker, and once your program is running on your board it will have a specific
memory address which you can store in a register, do arithmetic on, etc.</p>

<p class="think-box">What will you see in <code>r1</code> after the <code>ldr r1, cope</code> line? 
Can you guess the address of <code>cope</code> and find it in the memory viewer?</p>

<p>You’ll notice a
new <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Ascii.html#Ascii"><code>.ascii</code></a>
compiler directive in this code: this allows you to put data into your program
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> encoding. Fundamentally,
this is no different to the <code>.hword</code> directive earlier, only that instead of
using numbers (e.g. decimals like <code>5</code> or hexadecimals like <code>0xA2</code>) you’re using
the ASCII character code to determine exactly what bytes the assembler puts in
your program. But it’s all just bytes in the end—as you’ll soon see.</p>

<p>Your goal in this exercise is to isolate and shift individual bytes within the
<code>"COPE"</code> word:</p>

<ol>
  <li>first, change it into <code>"HOPE"</code> and store in <code>r2</code></li>
  <li>then, change it into <code>"HOPS"</code> and store in <code>r3</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these steps requires isolating and manipulating one 8-bit (1-character)
part of the 32-bit word without messing with the rest of it. As a hint, in the
ASCII character encoding you can add 5 to change a <code>C</code> into an <code>H</code> and add 14 to
change an <code>E</code> into an <code>S</code> (again, remember to look at your cheat sheet). The new
characters need to be shifted back into the correct position and then need to
replace the appropriate character in the original word.</p>

<p>It might be helpful to use a piece of paper here: write out what the <code>"COPE"</code>
data looks like in memory (remember endianness!), and figure out what shuffles
and logical operations you need to make the transformations into <code>"HOPS"</code>. If
you’re stuck, think what bit-vector operations will remove, replace or combine
information in your registers.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this, how many can you think of? Show your program
to your neighbour or tutor to get ideas about how it could be done differently.</p>

<p class="extension-box">You might have used one (or more) large numbers in your bit manipulation
adventures. How many bits is that number? Do you think it will fit into the
instruction encoding? Have a look at the disassembly, and cross check it with
the instruction manual. Can you make sense of what’s happening here? (Hint:
<a target="_blank" href="https://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/arm-immediate-value-encoding/">this blog post</a>
might be helpful to you). Give it a crack, but we will revisit this again later
in the course.</p>

<p>Finalise your program so that the <code>main</code> function performs the <code>"COPE"</code> -&gt;
<code>"HOPE"</code> -&gt; <code>"HOPS"</code> transformation and leaves the <code>"HOPS"</code> value in <code>r2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Congratulations! In this week’s lab you learned how to</p>

<ol>
  <li>watch what happens in memory as your program executes</li>
  <li>use the <code>.hword</code> and <code>.ascii</code> assembler directives to insert bytes into your
programs</li>
  <li>figure out the <em>exact</em> sequence of bits to get the discoboard to do what you want</li>
  <li>use simple bit-shifting instructions to isolate and manipulate specific bits
in a word</li>
  <li>read and write numbers in different bases: decimal, binary, hex</li>
</ol>

<p>Next lab, you’ll start taking this information to construct (and play!) a
simple game.</p>

<p class="info-box">Make sure you pack up your board and USB
cable, and adapter (if needed) carefully.</p>
